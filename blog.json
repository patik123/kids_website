                "html": "<p>Back again with a new post👋. This time I went a little deeper into what software testing means and what types of testing exist. Already during my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.thepatik.com/one-month-internship-at-hrc\">internship as a student</a>, I encountered automatic testing of web applications.</p>\n<p>This time I present the advantages and disadvantages of automatic testing and when it pays to introduce automatic testing in the development itself, and what we need to pay attention to when introducing automatic testing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689012688283/dc654ad7-8bb1-47a1-9c82-215167dea948.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>If you are a developer, then you have already heard that it is necessary to test the application several times before it goes into production. The application can be tested in two different ways, most often it is done manually, but there is also the option of automatic testing (yes, the computer itself can check that everything is working as expected).</p>\n<p>Manual testing is the execution of functional tests by “hands”, when we click on the application ourselves, and in this way, we find errors and bugs. Application testing is not only functional testing, if all functions work correctly, but application testing also includes a huge number of other types of testing.</p>\n<p>Other types of tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Cross-browser Testing</strong> – testing the application if it is working in different browsers</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Load and stress testing</strong> – testing the website's behavior in the event of an increased number of requests or users</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>UI testing (GUI Testing)</strong> – testing the user experience and appearance of the application/website under various conditions</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>A/B Testing</strong> – testing different versions of the application, which works better for the user</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Compatibility Testing</strong> – compatibility testing with different device configurations or servers</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Security Testing</strong> – testing the security of the application for any security vulnerabilities</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Smoke Testing</strong> – testing of the operation of the main functions in accordance with expectations</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Acceptance and Compliance Testing</strong> – testing if the application complies with the requirements and expectations of the project</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we can see, we can find that testing does not only include testing if all functions work correctly but also a lot of other types of tests.</p>\n<p>Manual testing can be very, very time-consuming if we have a complex application with a lot of features. This is why automated testing exists.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689011644993/f64e3333-de18-4b93-8389-7a54e38c8571.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-automatic-testing\">Automatic testing</h2>\n<p>Automated testing is testing that takes place without the intervention of a tester. It allows us to run application tests automatically.</p>\n<p>Automated testing is most often used in E2E (end-to-end) tests. These are tests that illustrate user behavior in the real world. There are also Unit tests, which are used to test individual functions of the application.</p>\n<p>Automated testing usually works together with integration in CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery).</p>\n<p>The power of automated testing is most apparent in larger applications/projects. For this reason, I do not recommend initiating automated testing in smaller projects. In smaller projects, you prefer to use manual testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-advantages-of-automated-testing\">Advantages of automated testing</h3>\n<p>Automated testing brings enormous advantages over manual testing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Speed</strong> – Automated testing is faster than manual testing</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>More frequent testing</strong> – automated tests can be run more frequently than manual tests (for example, after each push to Git).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher product quality</strong> – frequent testing reduces the chances of errors and bugs in the project and quick detection of these</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Reuse of scripts</strong> – all automated test code can be used in multiple places</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"heading-disadvantages-of-automated-testing\">Disadvantages of automated testing</h3>\n<p>Although automated testing has many advantages over manual software testing, it also has its disadvantages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>UI testing</strong> – automated testing is not suitable for UI testing</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>High initial costs</strong> – the initial costs of investing in automated testing can be very high (you need to buy software licenses, find someone who knows how to write tests…)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Constant correction</strong> – automatic tests need to be changed every time the program structure changes</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Generates false positives and false negatives</strong> – many times a test can fail and generate a false result</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689011716629/13bc743d-5ca1-449b-9a80-a7241d545a0f.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-factors-for-deciding-on-the-start-of-automated-testing\">Factors for deciding on the start of automated testing</h3>\n<p>Automated testing has its pros and cons, it's just a matter of when to decide to initiate automated tests into our development cycle.</p>\n<p>The biggest factor in integrating automated tests is the size of the application/project. If we have a smaller project with few functions, manual testing is still the most useful, but if we have several applications or one larger application with many functions, it would be wise to start thinking about automatic testing. Automated testing is easiest to implement on new projects when all members of the development team write tests for features as they are developed.</p>\n<p>The next question is how much money we are willing to invest in automated testing. There is no right answer here because we need to know what we want to test and in what way. There are free (open source) and paid solutions. It is also necessary to consider the costs of maintaining the tests when the product will change.</p>\n<p>The number of people in the team is also important, a larger team may decide that someone should be responsible for writing tests and the rest should focus on product development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-planning-automated-tests\">Planning automated tests</h3>\n<p>If we have determined that it would be worthwhile for us to start integrating automated tests, we must start with good planning, because only with a good plan will we achieve higher product quality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Deciding what we want to test</strong> – in the first step, we ask ourselves what we want to test, whether these are the main critical functions or something else</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Choosing the appropriate tool for testing</strong> – in the next step, we ask ourselves which tool would be the most optimal and best for us, here we also determine the work methodologies</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Planning the infrastructure</strong> – in the third step, we plan what kind of infrastructure we want to run the tests on, this includes planning the integration in CI/CD and the use of automation tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Planning and writing tests</strong> – in the fourth step, we start planning the writing of tests for our project. It is essential to test the written tests several times if they work correctly in different situations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong> – in the last fifth step, we must analyze the results of automatic tests and decide about the next steps (update some test scripts or write new tests)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we follow all these steps and everything else mentioned in the previous paragraphs, we can greatly increase the quality of the product/application.</p>\n<p>In a future article, however, I will try to present some frameworks for automated application testing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689011473973/5d78fcde-3a55-4286-92ce-c53d3b91d3b6.jpeg\" alt=\"Planning\" class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As we saw in the course of the article, testing automation can achieve higher product quality and free the tester to focus on other tests. Integrating automated testing requires a lot of planning to make the integration as successful as possible, but it pays off in the long run.</p>\n<p>I hope the post helped you, I will be happy about any comments and also likes.

Put simply, it refers to programs whose source code is publicly available. This code can typically be accessed through online Git repositories, with GitHub being one of the largest collections of open-source software available.</p>\n<p>You're likely already familiar with some examples of open-source software, such as MySQL, Visual Studio Code, Apache HTTP server, Mozilla Firefox Browser, VLC media player, and Linux OS. These programs and operating systems have all been developed using open-source methodologies.</p>\n<p>The benefits of open-source software are numerous and extend to developers and businesses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-better-security\">Better security</h2>\n<p>One common misconception about open-source software is that it is inherently less secure than closed-source software, as the code is publicly accessible and could be vulnerable to analysis by malicious actors. However, the reality is quite the opposite - open-source software is widely considered to be more secure than its closed-source counterparts.</p>\n<p>A prime example of this is the comparison between Windows and Linux operating systems. Windows has been plagued by numerous security vulnerabilities over the years, whereas Linux has a reputation for being more secure.</p>\n<p>This can largely be attributed to the \"many eyes\" phenomenon, in which a greater number of people can analyze the code and identify bugs and security flaws more quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-freedom\">Freedom</h2>\n<p>Another major advantage of open-source software is the freedom it provides. With open-source software, individuals and businesses can easily adapt the software to meet their specific needs. This level of customization is not possible with closed-source software, which is often restricted by licensing agreements and proprietary code.</p>\n<p>In practice, open-source software enables greater flexibility and control over the software, allowing for a more tailored user experience. This level of freedom is particularly important for businesses, as it enables them to adapt the software to meet their specific needs and gain a competitive advantage in their industry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682592788339/adbe6467-fb04-4f71-9a21-fca8a0514560.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-community-support\">Community support</h2>\n<p>One of the key strengths of open-source software is the strong sense of community that surrounds it. Open-source projects are often supported by large and passionate communities of developers and users, who are dedicated to improving the software and helping others to use it effectively.</p>\n<p>This community support can take many forms, including online forums, user groups, and developer communities. These resources provide a wealth of knowledge and expertise that can be invaluable when encountering issues with open-source software. The strength of the community also ensures that open-source software is constantly evolving and improving, as developers collaborate and share ideas to enhance the software's functionality and performance.</p>\n<p>For users and businesses, the community support provided by open-source software can be a major advantage, as it ensures that help is readily available when needed and that the software remains up-to-date and relevant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-transparency\">Transparency</h2>\n<p>Another important benefit of open-source software is the transparency it provides. Open-source software is developed in an open and collaborative environment, allowing anyone to view, edit, and review the source code.</p>\n<p>This level of transparency ensures that the software is free from hidden features or malicious code, increasing user confidence in the software's integrity. In contrast, closed-source software can sometimes hide unexpected or unwanted features, such as data collection, which can erode user trust and lead to privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>By providing full visibility into the code, open-source software enables users and businesses to fully understand how the software works and make informed decisions about its use. This transparency is particularly important in industries such as healthcare and finance, where trust and accountability are critical.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-a-free-alternative\">A free alternative</h2>\n<p>Open-source applications are often created to create an alternative to paid applications. It can also happen that the alternative to commercial applications is even better than the commercial application itself.</p>\n<p>These are just a few reasons why open source is so attractive, if you have any other ideas of your own why open source is so attractive, add it in the comments.</p>\n<p>If you like the content I create, connect with me at:</p>\n<p>🔷<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mstdn.social/@patik123\">Mastodon</a></p>\n<p>🔷<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-kosir/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n"

Physical violence typically results in physical injuries, while psychological violence can lead to psychological issues.</p>\n<p>Even seemingly harmless violence has consequences for the victim(s). However, if online aggression persists and intensifies, it can lead to further repercussions. In the worst-case scenario, which is unfortunately quite common, the victim may suffer from depression and suicidal tendencies and even take their own life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-what-can-the-victim-do\">What can the victim do?</h2>\n<p>As a victim of cyberbullying, it's important to speak up. Reach out to a trusted adult, such as a teacher, school counsellor, or parent, and work together to find a solution.

However, this is not true; all online activity can be traced back to its source.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cyberbullies can hide behind a mask of anonymity online and do not need direct physical access to their victims to do unimaginable harm. – Anna Maria Chavez</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The consequences of violence can be severe. Depending on the severity of the act, the perpetrator may face criminal charges, fines, jail time, and other penalties. In addition, they may suffer social, emotional, and psychological repercussions, such as public humiliation, loss of relationships, and difficulty finding employment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676220022912/8970d6f7-ecad-4466-b258-605c276232ba.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>It is important to remember that the person sending the messages is also legally responsible for their actions and could face imprisonment.</p>\n<p>I will end this post with this quote</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every call, email and text is a chance for you to send more love into the world.

I am currently ending my learnings in computer science at Celje and, in my free time, I give a lot of effort to improving my web development skills. I have been actively creating web solutions for three years now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-blogging\">Blogging✒</h2>\n<p>Over the year, I wrote 11 articles on my technical blog, which focused primarily on web development, computer science, and my personal experiences with these topics.</p>\n<p>Writing has become a passion of mine, as I thoroughly enjoy being able to share my knowledge with the world.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that knowledge is the only way to make progress and no matter where or when we learn, the value of writing an article to document what we've learned is priceless.</p>\n<p>Writing about what we know helps us not only expand our understanding but also gives others the chance to learn more about what we have discovered. It also allows us to connect with others who have similar interests, and to help one another grow in our shared understanding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1672074276061/4b00eec7-6af6-4f64-b1dd-ef0bc35a88e4.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>The most-read articles in 2022:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.thepatik.com/find-a-reason-why-to-write-a-blog\">Find A reason why to write a blog📚</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.thepatik.com/how-to-bypass-captcha\">How to bypass CAPTCHA?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.thepatik.com/what-is-crud\">What is CRUD?</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"heading-research-paper\">Research paper📚</h2>\n<p>At my high school, we create a good deal of research projects each year. This year, I made one too: a mobile application for my school centre, the largest in Slovenia—School Center Celje. I'm very proud of it.</p>\n<p>The ŠCC Mobile app was popular among all students. It simplified a lot of information from various sources. Unfortunately, I had to shut it down due to the School Center's requirements.</p>\n<p>I faced many challenges with the research project. The most important lesson I learned is to never give up, even in the face of failure.</p>\n<p>The research project was also presented at the national competition of young researchers in Murska Sobota.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1672074329342/6b25410f-dc07-469e-93b0-31eab84775da.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-presentation-of-my-school\">Presentation of my school🏛</h2>\n<p>In March, I had the opportunity to present my school, the Secondary School for Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science, on a day of open doors.</p>\n<p>I was excited to have the chance to explain why our school in Celje is an excellent choice for those looking for an education in the sciences.</p>\n<p>I was able to take advantage of this opportunity to practice my public speaking skills in front of a large audience. During the presentation, I was able to highlight the numerous advantages of our school.</p>\n<p>I was also able to showcase my research paper ŠCC Mobile.</p>\n<p>In the end, I'm proud to say that I was able to present my school in the best possible light, and I was thrilled to have had the chance to do so.</p>\n<p>What matters most to me is the experience of public speaking, in front of a big audience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-internship-at-hrc\">Internship at HRC👨‍💻</h2>\n<p>In June, I completed a mandatory internship at the local company HRC. They produce software for Slovenian and Croatian banks, called Hibis.</p>\n<p>During my daily tasks, I learned a lot of new things. My main task was to perform manual and automated testing of the online bank.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Working collaboratively with others can lead to faster, more efficient problem-solving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This experience made me realize that testing is an important part of development, which is often overlooked and not given enough attention. Testing helps to ensure that the product is of the highest quality before it is released to the public.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657786159081/Xa9oNzmmS.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp\" alt=\"HRC Žalec\" /></p>\n<p>I believe that schools should teach something about this topic. The most important lesson I learned from this experience was that if you have a development problem, you have a team of experts to help you solve it. Working collaboratively with others can lead to faster, more efficient problem-solving.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-sloveniaskills-2022-competition\">SloveniaSkills 2022 competition🏆</h2>\n<p>In September, my classmate Tilen Goršek and I represented the School Center of Celje in the SloveniaSkills competition in the field of computer science and informatics.</p>\n<p>The competition gave us real experience in setting up a network in a company, as well as how to secure the entire system. We learned about the advantages of using name servers and managing user authorizations.</p>\n<p>Though we weren't the most successful, my classmate and I gained valuable knowledge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1684658411876/3c48a252-ac8c-4759-a963-b17528a36114.jpeg\" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>Throughout the year, I encountered many people. I acquired a great deal of knowledge. What I appreciate the most is that there are countless opportunities to acquire new information at every turn; you just have to be proactive in finding them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-whats-coming\">What's coming? 🚀</h2>\n<p>Perfect question… For now, I know I will write a new research paper and create a new product, BiznisBox. What's more, we'll see what the year brings. Before that, I'll finish high school and enrol in the university.</p>\n"

Nextcloud is open-source software that allows us to build our digital cloud.</p>\n<p>Nextcloud is an excellent alternative to big fishes like Dropbox, Office 365 and Google Drive, as it allows for a massive amount of expansion and many extra functions that are unavailable in any of the commercial programs listed above.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nextcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/logo.png\" alt=\"Nextcloud logo\" class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p>\n<p>The software also has the option of installing a tool for group file editing and an online editor of documents, layouts, and tables like that of Microsoft Office. Nextcloud also allows you to make video calls and send direct messages.</p>\n<p>By adding plugins, Nextcloud can become the ultimate productivity tool.</p>\n<p>Nextcloud is also used in companies and also in the German government and schools.</p>\n<h1 id=\"heading-how-do-i-set-up-my-server\">How do I set up my server?</h1>\n<p>I've taken tons of photos in my life, and last year Google Photos introduced a photo upload limit. So, some time ago, I ran out of space in the Google Photo service. So, I had one computer at home, which I did not use in principle, and I installed the Ubuntu operating system.</p>\n<p>I chose the Ubuntu operating system because it is used and because it has a nice graphical interface (if I ever decide to take my computer with me).</p>\n<p>First, it was necessary to update all packages to the latest version.</p>\n<p>How I went about installing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nextcloud.com/\">Nextcloud</a> on Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>There is already a package for easy installation of Nextcloud in the Snap online market and it contains everything we need (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud\">installation package link</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670003097827/4e3ab497-4900-44b0-a837-0109457f05a8.jpeg\" alt /></p>\n<p>All we have to do is install this package. The easiest way to do this is with a simple command.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">sudo snap install nextcloud\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, inside my home local network, I entered the IP address of my computer in the web browser installed Nextcloud to the end and created a user account to access the installation.</p>\n<p>Such an installation is only available within a local network? But what if I want to access my “cloud” also from some other network?</p>\n<p>There are many solutions for this as well, from redirecting your router to a suitable computer, setting up a VPN server at home or tunnelling. Tuning turned out to be the most optimal and cheapest solution for me.</p>\n<p>I always host my domains with Cloudflare because it gives me many free features. Some free services are CDN with unlimited bandwidth, static website hosting, DNS domain hosting with unlimited DNS records, Cloudflare Tunnels, DDoS website protection…</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-cloudflare-tunnels\">Cloudflare Tunnels</h2>\n<p>Usually, to access your server at home in a private network, you need a static IP and port forwarding on the router.</p>\n<p>But there are tunnels in the networking. Like in the real world, tunnels are designed to overcome obstacles. In our case, the obstacle is our local network. Network tunnels allow us to create secure connections to our application on the server, something like a VPN.</p>\n<p>In case we already have our domain on Cloudflare DNS, then creating tunnels is accessible like a cake. We only need to install the Cloudflare application on the device (only one command on Linux) and then we can set up the applications hosted on the device in the Cloudflare GUI.</p>\n<p>The first step of installing Cloudflare Tunnels. We must install this little package into our system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670002794413/61a5809c-654f-4ab2-aabb-a8abc43ab338.png\" alt /></p>\n<p>And then set our public hostnames. What is simple, is just enter the subdomain of the domain which we like and then set the hostname on the device URL.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670002873089/7e36d276-a456-4113-b5e3-ffcd01a59481.png\" alt /></p>\n<p>We can use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/\">Cloudflare Tunnels</a> for SSH or RDP access to our machine.</p>\n<p>The function is also proper when we want to show a prototype of our product.</p>\n<p>I hope this article helped you to discover how easy it is to set up your own media server.</p>\n<p>Till next time 👋.</p>\n"

The order increased the transparency of personal data's use and collection, transmission and use.</p>\n<p>The GDPR requires every developer of web applications/sites to draw up a privacy policy in which data is collected about who collects personal data (it can be a natural or legal person), what data is collected and how it is obtained. It is necessary to be aware that the amount of collected personal data must be limited to a minimum, which means that we must not collect more data “in case we need it sometime in the future”. It is also necessary to provide a contact whom the visitor/user can contact in case he wants to exercise his rights under the GDPR. At the same time, it is necessary to specify the user's rights.</p>\n<p>The document in which we describe this is called the <strong>privacy policy.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"heading-cookies\">Cookies</h2>\n<p>Cookies are very popular for storing data in user sessions, and services for website visit analytics are very popular on websites.</p>\n<p>The European directive on electronic privacy (ePrivacy) requires the companies to offer the user, in the case of using cookies for analytics, and marketing, the option of choosing if they agree to the use of services.</p>\n<p>In practice, this usually means.

So, I spent a lot of time…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a fantastic experience because I gained experience I would never have in school.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In June, I did a four-week mandatory internship at the local company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrc.si/eng/home-eng\">HRC</a> in Žalec, Slovenia. I did my internship with my classmate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilen-gor%C5%A1ek-b49bba234\">Tilen Goršek</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657786108807/KNK4-kcMH.jpg\" alt=\"HRC Žalec \" /></p>\n<p>HRC is a company that produces software for most Slovenian and a few Croatian banks and savings banks. The company produces practically everything that a bank needs for its operation, from a mobile app to an app for work at the front office of the bank. The product they make is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrc.si/eng/platform\">Hibis</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned is that there are never any stupid questions, you will always get an answer to a question, you just have to ask if something is not clear to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before starting work in the assigned position, I had to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which prevents the disclosure of customer and company data. I was introduced to the rules of work in the company and also how to act by the ISO 27001 standard (standard for information security).</p>\n<p>As an intern, I was assigned to the Digital Channels department, more precisely in the department where they create an electronic bank. My task was to find mistakes that programmers make when creating an application. In the beginning, I looked for bugs and errors manually, but in the second week, automated testing with the Ranorex Studio software came into play. A lot of test cases are already written, but I also wrote one according to a pre-written specification. </p>\n<p>I got an insight into how software development is done in a team and what DevOps looks like on a real project.</p>\n<p>During my four weeks at HRC, I learned a lot about how banking systems work, which I didn't know much about before, and the importance of testing software before sending it to production. I also learned a lot about working in a company and information security. It was a fantastic experience because I gained experience I would never have in school.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657786159081/Xa9oNzmmS.jpg\" alt=\"HRC Žalec\" /></p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned is that there are never any stupid questions, you will always get an answer to a question, you just have to ask if something is not clear to you.</p>\n<p>I will most likely return to HRC, as I see many opportunities for personal advancement in the company.</p>\n<p>Until next time 👋.</p>\n"
